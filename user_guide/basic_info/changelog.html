<h1>Change Log</h1>

<p class="important"><b>Note:</b> Some links in this changelog may not work.
    This is since features get added/removed from the user guide and I do not
    update old links.</p>

<h2>Version 1.0</h2>

<p>Release Date: TBA<br/>
    SVN Revision: TBA

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Improved the ACL feature so it is simpler to user and more powerful. (#63)</li>
    <li>Brand new backend UI design & stylesheets. (#137, #128)</li>
    <li>Changed the licence which BackendPro is distributed as. (#144)</li>
    <li>Moved to a <b>PHP 5</b> only system design.</li>
    <li>Re-wrote a lot of the classes cleaning up the code.</li>
    <li>Removed the option to <strong>disable</strong> a user group. This feature wasn't implemented and didn't seem
        needed.
    </li>
    <li>Re-styled the status messages which are shown inside BackendPro. (#119)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug where no default user group was provided when registering a new user. (#181)</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where on registering a new user their password is encoded twice. (#179)</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where Access permissions didn't get saved. (#143)</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where <dfn>$this->Authentication->current_user();</dfn> didn't return <kbd>FALSE</kbd> if the user
        wasn't logged in. (#165)
    </li>
    <li>Replaced the use of the Ereg function which has been deprecated. (#138)</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where an error was thrown when saving settings in the Control Panel. (#141)</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where the Insert User model method didn't check its paramters where in the correct format. (#175)
    <li>Fixed some 'jumping' div elements on the Access Control Page. (#127)</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where you couldn't save any preferences back into the database. (#141)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.6.1</h2>

<p>Release Date: 12th August 2009<br/>
    SVN Revision: 257</p>

<h3>Libraries</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Moved the <b>Admin_Controller</b> and <b>Public_Controller</b> to their own seperate files.
        This keeps it so there is 1 class per file. (#99)
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Models</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Stopped the preference model from making multiple queries to the DB whenever a preference was fetched. Now they
        are
        all fetched and cached. (#135)
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bugs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug saying Bep_assets could not find an asset file when attempting to create an asset cache. (#134)</li>
    <li>Fixed bugs in the install process where files where not being checked if they where really writeable. (#133)
    </li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where it would report <strong>Cannot load library: bep_site</strong>. (#132)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.6</h2>

<p>Release Date: 16th July 2009<br/>
    SVN Revision: 244</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Turned back on the feature to enable Page debug in the system settings panel.</li>
    <li><kbd>The website maintenance mode option has been removed</kbd>. This is due to the fact that putting the
        website
        in maintenance mode still required a fully working BeP site with DB (which may not be the case if real
        maintenance
        was being done). (#114)
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added a new Site &amp; Assets library. These two new libraries take over the role of the single
        now <strong>deprecated</strong> Page library. They implement a new asset management system
        with added features.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bugs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Upgrade the use of <dfn>$this-&gt;db-&gt;trans_start()</dfn> to <dfn>$this-&gt;db-&gt;trans_begin()</dfn> in all
        BackendPro
        classes since this is what the CI user guide suggests. (#108)
    </li>
    <li>Corrected an issue where the install process was using the old asset files. (#124)</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where upon install the CI base_url was incorrect due to an extra trailing slash. (#67)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.5.1</h2>

<p>Release Date: 23rd May 2009<br/>
    SVN Revision: 232</p>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a major security issue where if you had both Username &amp; Email as valid login fields. Entering just a
        valid email would log you into the system. (#106)
    </li>
    <li>Corrected a typo in the userguide on the Image Controller page. (#103)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.5</h2>

<p>Release Date: 21st March 2009<br/>
    SVN Revision: 225</a></p>

<h3>Additions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added a section into the user guide to talk about the file system and matchbox. (#10)</li>
    <li>JS Code Output - The Page class now has the feature to <a href="../features/page.html#set_js">store JS code</a>
        and then output it into a view (very much like the PHP to JS variable converter). See (#84)
    </li>
    <li>i18n Support - The status class language strings are now contained within a language file. (#75)</li>
    <li>CI Profiler Intergration - The CI profiler is now intergrated into the admin control panel. When turned on in
        the <a href="../features/preferences.html#page_debug">system settings</a> rather than some of the output being
        hidden it is now clearly visible. (#41)
    </li>
    <li>Login Selection - It is now possible to select how a user can login, either with their email, username or
        either.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Modifications</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The <a href="../features/page.html#icon">page->icon()</a> method now accepts a title paramter for the displayed
        image.
    </li>
    <li>Moved some of the dashboard files into their own module to tidy the file system up a bit. Also have created a
        new class to store to Statistics Widget creation code it.
    </li>
    <li>Improved the <dfn>is_user()</dfn> method so if <dfn>$config['sess_use_database']</dfn> is <var>FALSE</var> then
        extra user checks are performed. For this to work the value returned by validateLogin() has changed. (#80)
    </li>
    <li>Removed PHP short tags from files, See <a href="http://trac2.assembla.com/backendpro/ticket/42">Task #42</a>
    </li>
    <li>Added some extra language strings for the dropdown options inside <var>application/controllers/admin/settings.php</var>.
        (#73)
    </li>
    <li>Updated the Page Module so it uses the functions in the <a
            href="http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/helpers/html_helper.html">CodeIgniter HTML helper</a>. (#36)
    </li>
    <li>Changed the MY_Controller so the charset header and metatag value is taken from the CI config file. (#74)</li>
    <li>Altered the default dashboard statistics panel so it now also shows the current CodeIgniter version.</li>
    <li>Changed the way the install process is done. Now you can specify your CI folder structure.(#53)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The dashboard widget system now restores moved widgets. (#64)</li>
    <li>The BackendPro tree menu in the admin panel now saves its open/closes status rather than it being lost between
        different pages. (#15, #145)
    </li>
    <li>Redirection upon login is now fixed. (#100)</li>
    <li>Spelling errors throughout the code. (#71, #76, #77)</li>
    <li>Corrected the user guide section on the <a href="../features/page.html#output_breadcrumb">Page</a> class.
        Originally it listed <strong>output_trail()</strong> as a method this is now <strong>output_breadcrumb</strong>.
        (#69)
    </li>
    <li>Modified the path to the user guide from inside the <strong>BackendPro</strong> control panel (footer). (#68)
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.4</h2>

<p>Release Date: 13th Dec 2008<br/>
    SVN Revision: 177</a></p>

<h3>Additions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added a new readonly style for the forms. Now if a form input is readonly add the class
        <strong>readonly</strong> to it to display a greyed out look. (#44)
    </li>
    <li>Added the new <a href="../features/image_controller.html">Image controller</a> which allows images to be loaded
        dynamically.
    </li>
    <li>Added a new <a href="../features/views.html#popup_container">Popup Container</a> which allows a popup window to
        be created with all the advantages of the <strong>BackendPro</strong> system, but without the
        navigation/footer/header.
    </li>
    <li>A new and improved install script. It now performs system checks (e.g log folder writable) and gives detailed
        information on the process.
    </li>
    <li>New documentation in the user guide about the process of upgrading versions of <strong>BackendPro</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Modifications</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Removed the BackendPro class and instead incoperated the library loading code into the Site_Controller class.
    </li>
    <li>Moved the welcome controller and view to its own module so its easy for the user to delete.</li>
    <li>Fixed some spelling errors both in the user guide and in the code.</li>
    <li>Removed the webmaster name/email preferences since these seemed old fashioned and also were not used by the base
        system.
    </li>
</ul>

        assign them to a permission. (#57)
    </li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where when modifying a permission, instead of saving it, it created a new permission. (#20)</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where status messages would get repeated if an ajax controller method was called. (#4)</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where if no user profile fields are created but the user profiles are turned on, it would error
        saying "Must you set method" when trying to save a edited user account. (#51)
    </li>
    <li>Fixed a bug with <strong>unserialize() Spamming logs with errors</strong>. (#37)</li>
